{"name":"Adaptiveware","tagline":"HTML5 Everywhere","body":"## Well, hullo thar!\r\n\r\nYou can find the [Adaptiveware Community](https://community.adaptiveware.org) site [here](https://community.adaptiveware.org) (as soon as it's up and running). Adaptiveware will also provide freemium features and goodies and will be available on the [Adaptiveware](http://www.adaptiveware.eu) website.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nAdaptiveware is a multi-platform hybrid application development, runtime and build platform. The goal of this project is to devise a common high-level interface for different types of devices - from smart watches, smart glasses and smartphones all the way to smart TVs - and to bind those interfaces to an HTML5-capable browser engine from where they can be accessed using JavaScript. The browser engine is enriched with OS specific implementations of those interfaces that are exposed at DOM level so that web developers can leverage their skills to create hybrid applications using HTML, JavaScript and CSS3 on all of the supported platforms, providing rich user-experiences using a common code-base on a broad spectrum of devices.\r\n\r\nEvidently, not all OSes and devices provide have the same software or hardware capabilities but Adaptiveware makes it easy to interrogate the platform at runtime using a common JavaScript API to determine the profile of a device, and the support for certain features, using a unified API across all platforms.\r\n\r\nDevice types in scope:\r\n\r\n* **Smartwatches** (Watchfaces/SmallApps created with Javascript, not rendered in HTML5 engine)\r\n\t* Pebble \r\n\t* Metawatch\r\n\t* I'm Watch\r\n\t* Sony Smartwatch\r\n* **Smartglasses**\r\n\t* Google Glass\r\n\t* Vuzix Smartwatches (if they're kind enough to donate a license ^^)\r\n* **Smartphones & Tablets**\r\n\t* Apple iOS (v5 onwards)\r\n\t* Google Android (v4 onwards)\r\n\t* RIM BlackBerry (v10 onwards)\r\n\t* Windows Mobile/Phone (v7.5 onwards)\r\n\t* Windows 8/RT (tablet-things)\r\n\t* Ubuntu Touch\r\n\t* Firefox OS\r\n* **Netbooks**\r\n\t* Chrome OS\r\n\t* Firefox OS\r\n\t* Ubuntu Touch \r\n* **Desktop**\r\n\t* Mac OSX\r\n\t* Linux\r\n\t* Windows (.NET4 onwards)\r\n* **TVs**\r\n\t* Samsung SmartTV (2012 onwards)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute & Contact\r\n* **Issue tracking:** [https://community.adaptiveware.org/jira](https://community.adaptiveware.org/jira)\r\n* **Documentation:** [https://community.adaptiveware.org/wiki](https://community.adaptiveware.org/wiki)\r\n* **Author:** [Carlos Lozano Diez](mailto:carlos@adaptiveware.eu)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the [**Mozilla Public License, v2.0**](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Carlos Lozano Diez <carlos@adaptiveware.eu> t/a Adaptiveware.\r\n\r\nThis Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. \r\n2.0.
